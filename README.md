## Open Collaboration
January 28, 2018

Slides available at: http://bit.ly/OpenCollabS19

Open Collaboration introduces the principles of this Open movement and investigates its impact on Science and research. This workshop includes opportunities for discussion and reflection on Open Science principles and ideas for devising concrete ways for improving open practices locally in a department, institute, or lab environment. Researchers will learn about the idea of working openly and collaboratively and will be able to evaluate the use of tools like GitHub and the Open Science Framework. 

## Open Research Data
February 4, 2018

Open Research Data identifies the importance of sharing research data and introduces the tools necessary for transparent reporting that is reproducible and readable. In this workshop participants will learn how to donate data that complies with FAIR data principles to public repositories and quickly identify and select data appropriate for reuse. Researchers will be able to apply a range of resources to devise and implement a workflow for reproducible research including using lab notebooks and tools for sharing code and data. 

## Public Engagement with Science
February 11, 2018

Public Engagement with Science introduces a range of utilities for publishing and sharing your research openly and with the widest audience possible. This workshop encourages participants to evaluate perspectives on Open Access including specific issues related to copyright, article status, repositories, and economics, and identifies a range of outlets available for archiving and publishing. Researchers will be able to identify and describe a variety of stakeholders and audiences and employ a number of methods for strategic science communication.
